Dancing Dragon,Katherine Chin & Parke MacDowell,2024,"Highway construction in the 1960s dismantled a tight-knit community by displacing hundreds of immigrant households along Hudson Street in Boston's Chinatown. Dancing Dragon occupies the small greenspace between these projects to reinforce the cultural identity of Chinatown. Inspired by the spirit of a traditional dragon dance, the undulating canopy resembles the energetic movements of a dragon.","PAYETTE, Beyond Walls, Mayor’s Office of Arts & Culture, Perkins&Will, Utile, Healthy Places by Design, John Hancock, Beyer Blinder Belle Foundation, Boston Global Investors, AARP Massachusetts, UMass Boston, City of Boston Age Strong Commission, John’s Landscape Service, Matt Construction, Concentric Fabrication, BPDA/EDIC, Lawrence Chan, Stantec, Lim Consultants, McPhail Associates, Tufts University, Bozzuto, Maloney Properties, and One Greenway.
